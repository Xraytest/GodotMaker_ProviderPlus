# Contributing to GodotMaker

Thank you for your interest in contributing to GodotMaker! This guide will help you get started.

## Code of Conduct

This project follows the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

1. Search [existing issues](https://github.com/RandallLiuXin/GodotMaker/issues) to avoid duplicates.
2. Use the **Bug Report** issue template.
3. Include: Godot version, OS, steps to reproduce, expected vs actual behavior.

### Suggesting Features

1. Open an issue using the **Feature Request** template.
2. Describe the use case and why it benefits the project.

### Submitting Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create a branch from `main`.
2. Follow the coding conventions below.
3. Write or update tests for your changes.
4. **Run benchmarks** — you must verify your changes do not regress performance before submitting. Include benchmark results in the PR description.
5. Run the full validation pipeline locally:
   ```bash
   # Run tests
   pytest
   godot --headless --path . -s res://addons/gdUnit4/bin/GdUnitCmdTool.gd --add res://test/ --ignoreHeadlessMode

   # Gitleaks (runs automatically via pre-commit hook)
   gitleaks detect --source .
   ```
6. Add a changelog entry to [`docs/update/next.md`](docs/update/next.md) describing your change. Rules:
   - **One sentence per bullet.** If you can't fit it, your bullet is doing two things — split it.
   - **Describe user-facing intent, not the investigation behind it.** No incident dates, no internal project / test names, no debugging narrative. Past `vX.Y.Z.md` archives are the format reference.
   - **Use `(WIP)` only when the change itself is incomplete**. The prefix exists so the release-prep agent doesn't promote unfinished work into a tagged release — don't dilute it.
7. Open a PR against `main` using the [PR template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md).

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Godot 4.x (with .NET support recommended)
- Python 3.10+
- .NET SDK 8.0+
- [gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks-io/gitleaks) (for secret scanning)

### Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RandallLiuXin/GodotMaker.git
cd GodotMaker

# Install git hooks (gitleaks pre-commit)
bash scripts/install-hooks.sh

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Coding Conventions

### GDScript / C#

- Follow the [GDScript style guide](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_styleguide.html).
- Code and comments in **English**.
- ECS systems must declare `reads`, `writes`, `creates_node`, `requires_node` metadata.
- Physics callbacks must never manipulate the node tree directly — use `DestroyTag` + `set_deferred`.

### Python (tools/)

- Follow PEP 8.
- Type hints encouraged.
- Tests in `tests/` using pytest.

### Commit Messages

- Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/): `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`.
- Keep the first line under 72 characters.
- Reference related issues: `Fixes #123`.

## Branch Strategy

- `main` — stable, always passing CI.
- Feature branches: `feat/short-description`.
- Bug fix branches: `fix/short-description`.

## Review Process

1. All PRs require at least one review.
2. CI must pass before merge.
3. Benchmark verification is mandatory — reviewers will check for performance data in the PR description.
