# Roadmap

> Turn natural-language game descriptions into playable Godot projects, powered by ECS and AI orchestration.

This roadmap tracks what has shipped, what we are working on now, and where the project is headed.

## Completed

### v0.1 — Foundation

- [x] `R-001` Project skeleton and repository setup
- [x] `R-002` Asset pipeline tools (asset_gen, rembg, sprite utilities)
- [x] `R-003` Skill infrastructure and publish pipeline

### v0.2 — Skills

- [x] `R-010` 13 core skills (orchestrator, godot-api, headless-build, gdunit-driver, gdtoolkit, gecs, game-planner, project-scaffold, visual-qa, screenshot, mcp-driver, godot-e2e, input-mapper)
- [x] `R-011` 8 reviewer skills (physics, animation, ui, tilemap, navigation, shader, audio, particles)
- [x] `R-012` Capability skills (headless-build, gdunit-driver, godot-e2e, gdtoolkit, visual-qa)

### v0.3 — Pipeline

- [x] `R-020` Multi-agent orchestrator pipeline (game-planner → scaffold → generate → validate)
- [x] `R-021` Stage gate validation with schema enforcement
- [x] `R-022` Hook system (8 hooks: pre-commit, SubagentStop, worktree lifecycle, etc.)
- [x] `R-023` Metrics and state tracking subsystem

### v0.4 — Polish

- [x] `R-030` Semantic versioning with publish-time upgrade prompts
- [x] `R-031` Hooks migration to `.godotmaker/` (git-tracked, worktree-safe)
- [x] `R-032` Wiki documentation (30 pages)
- [x] `R-033` CI workflow (lint, test, gitleaks)

### v0.x — Role-based pipeline

- [x] `R-070` **Permission isolation — file-lock baseline** — Each role's write scope is enforced by `check_file_permissions.py` reading `.godotmaker/current_role` (set as the first action of every `/gm-*` skill). Hooks reject out-of-scope writes (e.g. only `/gm-evaluate` may write `e2e/`). The file-lock + hook approach was chosen over heavier alternatives after evaluation; harder isolation is tracked as `R-073`.
- [x] `R-071` **Pipeline decomposition** — Split monolithic orchestrator skill into 9 role-based skills (`/gm-scaffold`, `/gm-gdd`, `/gm-asset`, `/gm-build`, `/gm-verify`, `/gm-evaluate`, `/gm-fixgap`, `/gm-accept`, `/gm-finalize`). Each role owns a single phase and write-permission scope; `gm-evaluate` owns `e2e/` exclusively.
- [x] `R-072` **Shared reference docs (`_shared/`)** — Cross-skill reference docs (worker/verifier/reviewer/analyst dispatch) live as a single source of truth and are reverse-deployed by `publish_shared_refs()` into each consumer's `references/` with an `<!-- AUTO-GENERATED -->` header.

## In Progress

### v0.x - Playability and Visual Contracts

- [x] `R-080` **Playable Unit contract** - Make one minimal playable unit the core planning unit for `/gm-gdd`, the decomposer, and `PLAN.md`. Each unit must describe the player experience, the unit outcome, scenes involved, and each mechanic's player operation/content, expected effect, required visible content, and evidence.
- [x] `R-081` **Playability scenario contract** - Turn each Playable Unit into evaluate-owned runtime coverage: player-facing operations, state assertions, visible-content checkpoints, and explicit failure criteria. Scope excludes a general AI player or RL system; the first target is deterministic proof that every required unit row can actually be played.
- [x] `R-082` **Visual prompt style guide** - Add a stable `STYLE.md` artifact used as the source of truth for later image prompts. It should capture a compact style anchor, prompt suffix, UI/asset generation rules, avoid list, and reference notes. Evaluation does not judge style drift.
- [ ] `R-083` **Reference object curation and asset integration** - Turn generated scene references into a usable asset source before build: decide which references are suitable, regenerate extraction atlases when needed, crop objects with the appropriate tool, select canonical references when multiple candidates conflict, record rejected/variant candidates, map accepted objects into `ASSETS.md` / `assets/manifest.json`, and protect the resulting contracts from build/fixgap shortcuts.
- [x] `R-084` **Best-effort evaluate evidence archive** - When a tag is finalized, archive the existing E2E tests and screenshots under `docs/tags/<Tag>/evidence/` when available and summarize them in `final_report.json`. Evidence archive gaps are warnings, not finalize blockers.

## Future / Exploring

### Permission & Pipeline

- `R-073` **Tamper-proof role identity via external harness** — `R-070`'s file-lock relies on each `/gm-*` skill honestly writing `.godotmaker/current_role`; nothing structurally prevents the main agent from rewriting the file mid-session. A separate harness process (tracked outside this repo, in a separate automation host) drives each role as its own Claude Code subprocess with the role injected via env var, so hooks can read identity from the runtime instead of the filesystem.
- `R-074` **SKILL-shared scripts as `_shared_scripts/`** — Mirror `R-072`'s pattern for executable scripts. `tools/asset_gen.py` / `find_loop_frame.py` / `rembg_matting.py` / `check_project.py` / `append_stage_event.py` are invoked from one or more SKILLs but live at top-level `tools/`, drifting from the official Claude Code "SKILL self-contained" convention. Move them to a new `skills/core/_shared_scripts/` source-of-truth and have `publish.py` fan them out into each consumer's `<skill>/scripts/` at deploy time (manifest-driven, sibling to `_shared/manifest.json`). After this lands, top-level `tools/` is reserved for user/CI-invoked scripts (`migrate.py`, `publish.py`, `check_classname.py`).
- `R-075` **Cross-session resume contract** — Today, when a predecessor `claude -p` session dies mid-`/gm-fixgap` (e.g. quota cut-off after worker DONE but before main agent wrote MEMORY / advanced GAP / archived / appended stage event), the next session's startup recovery is 100% agent improvisation: no spec, no tests, no canonical decision table. The 0509 e2e run made it work by luck — iter 2's startup archived iter 1's GAP "in absentia" because the model happened to read the right tea leaves. **Scope**: write a formal resume contract for each `/gm-*` SKILL — given (last stage event, GAP.md status, evaluation.json status, current_role file), what's the canonical next step? Add tests covering at minimum: predecessor died after worker DONE before archive; predecessor died after archive before stage event append; predecessor died mid-evaluate; ts corruption in last stage event. Lives at the SKILL contract layer, not the agent prompt layer — so the resume behavior is reproducible across model swaps.

### Framework Features

Items below are ideas under consideration — not committed to a timeline.

- `R-100` **TileMap support** — Terrain systems, tileset asset generation, and TileMap-based level design. Currently deferred; sprite-placement is the recommended terrain approach until this ships.
- `R-101` **ECS framework migration** — Migrate tindercore (C++ GDExtension) from EnTT to flecs, then adopt tindercore as the ECS runtime replacing gecs.
- `R-102` **Scene-markers skill** — Marker type → component composition mapping for ECS entity spawning.
- `R-103` **System DAG checker CLI** — Static dependency analysis for ECS systems at build time.
- `R-104` **gdUnit ECS test templates** — Reusable test fixtures for ECS system testing.
- `R-105` **DestructionSystem and Node lifecycle** — Entity destruction protocol and component add/remove lifecycle.
- `R-106` **Multi-platform game publishing** — One-click export and publish to Steam, iOS, Google Play, Web. Includes export preset generation, platform-specific assets, store metadata templates, and CI/CD integration.
- `R-107` **Pattern skills** — Per-genre architecture templates (e.g., top-down shooter, platformer, tower defense). Built from real pipeline runs, not theoretical.
- `R-108` **Tester subagent** — Dedicated E2E and gameplay testing role in the multi-agent pipeline.
- `R-109` **GDD quality review** — Automated completeness and consistency checks on generated Game Design Documents.
- `R-110` **Android build workflow** — APK/AAB export with signing, versioning, and store-ready packaging.
- `R-111` **Sprite sheet animation pipeline** — Generate multi-frame sprite sheets from single-frame AI-generated sprites.
- `R-112` **Re-evaluate gdtoolkit (gdlint / gdformat)** *(low priority)* — Disabled in v0.3.4 due to recurring `gdtoolkit/linter/class_checks.py:144 NotImplementedError` crashes on ECS-style class shapes. Rationale + restore guide in [`docs/decisions/disable-gdtoolkit.md`](docs/decisions/disable-gdtoolkit.md).
