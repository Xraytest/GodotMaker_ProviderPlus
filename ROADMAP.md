# Roadmap

> Turn natural-language game descriptions into playable Godot projects, powered by ECS and AI orchestration.

This roadmap tracks what has shipped, what we are working on now, and where the project is headed.

## Completed

### v0.1 — Foundation

- [x] `R-001` Project skeleton and repository setup
- [x] `R-002` Asset pipeline tools (asset_gen, rembg, sprite utilities)
- [x] `R-003` Skill infrastructure and publish pipeline

### v0.2 — Skills

- [x] `R-010` 13 core skills (orchestrator, godot-api, headless-build, gdunit-driver, gdtoolkit, gecs, game-planner, project-scaffold, visual-qa, screenshot, mcp-driver, godot-e2e, input-mapper)
- [x] `R-011` 8 reviewer skills (physics, animation, ui, tilemap, navigation, shader, audio, particles)
- [x] `R-012` Capability skills (headless-build, gdunit-driver, godot-e2e, gdtoolkit, visual-qa)

### v0.3 — Pipeline

- [x] `R-020` Multi-agent orchestrator pipeline (game-planner → scaffold → generate → validate)
- [x] `R-021` Stage gate validation with schema enforcement
- [x] `R-022` Hook system (8 hooks: pre-commit, SubagentStop, worktree lifecycle, etc.)
- [x] `R-023` Metrics and state tracking subsystem

### v0.4 — Polish

- [x] `R-030` Semantic versioning with publish-time upgrade prompts
- [x] `R-031` Hooks migration to `.godotmaker/` (git-tracked, worktree-safe)
- [x] `R-032` Wiki documentation (30 pages)
- [x] `R-033` CI workflow (lint, test, gitleaks)

### v0.x — Role-based pipeline

- [x] `R-070` **Permission isolation — file-lock baseline** — Each role's write scope is enforced by `check_file_permissions.py` reading `.godotmaker/current_role` (set as the first action of every `/gm-*` skill). Hooks reject out-of-scope writes (e.g. only `/gm-evaluate` may write `e2e/`). The file-lock + hook approach was chosen over heavier alternatives after evaluation; harder isolation is tracked as `R-073`.
- [x] `R-071` **Pipeline decomposition** — Split monolithic orchestrator skill into 9 role-based skills (`/gm-scaffold`, `/gm-gdd`, `/gm-asset`, `/gm-build`, `/gm-verify`, `/gm-evaluate`, `/gm-fixgap`, `/gm-accept`, `/gm-finalize`). Each role owns a single phase and write-permission scope; `gm-evaluate` owns `e2e/` exclusively.
- [x] `R-072` **Shared reference docs (`_shared/`)** — Cross-skill reference docs (worker/verifier/reviewer/analyst dispatch) live as a single source of truth and are reverse-deployed by `publish_shared_refs()` into each consumer's `references/` with an `<!-- AUTO-GENERATED -->` header.

- [ ] `R-060` [gdfxr](https://github.com/timothyqiu/gdfxr) — Retro sound effect generator (sfxr port)

## Future / Exploring

### Permission & Pipeline

- `R-073` **Tamper-proof role identity via external harness** — `R-070`'s file-lock relies on each `/gm-*` skill honestly writing `.godotmaker/current_role`; nothing structurally prevents the main agent from rewriting the file mid-session. A separate harness process (tracked outside this repo, in a separate automation host) drives each role as its own Claude Code subprocess with the role injected via env var, so hooks can read identity from the runtime instead of the filesystem.
- `R-074` **SKILL-shared scripts as `_shared_scripts/`** — Mirror `R-072`'s pattern for executable scripts. `tools/asset_gen.py` / `find_loop_frame.py` / `rembg_matting.py` / `check_project.py` / `append_stage_event.py` are invoked from one or more SKILLs but live at top-level `tools/`, drifting from the official Claude Code "SKILL self-contained" convention. Move them to a new `skills/core/_shared_scripts/` source-of-truth and have `publish.py` fan them out into each consumer's `<skill>/scripts/` at deploy time (manifest-driven, sibling to `_shared/manifest.json`). After this lands, top-level `tools/` is reserved for user/CI-invoked scripts (`migrate.py`, `publish.py`, `check_classname.py`).

### Framework Features

Items below are ideas under consideration — not committed to a timeline.

- `R-100` **TileMap support** — Terrain systems, tileset asset generation, and TileMap-based level design. Currently deferred; sprite-placement is the recommended terrain approach until this ships.
- `R-101` **ECS framework migration** — Migrate tindercore (C++ GDExtension) from EnTT to flecs, then adopt tindercore as the ECS runtime replacing gecs.
- `R-102` **Scene-markers skill** — Marker type → component composition mapping for ECS entity spawning.
- `R-103` **System DAG checker CLI** — Static dependency analysis for ECS systems at build time.
- `R-104` **gdUnit ECS test templates** — Reusable test fixtures for ECS system testing.
- `R-105` **DestructionSystem and Node lifecycle** — Entity destruction protocol and component add/remove lifecycle.
- `R-106` **Multi-platform game publishing** — One-click export and publish to Steam, iOS, Google Play, Web. Includes export preset generation, platform-specific assets, store metadata templates, and CI/CD integration.
- `R-107` **Pattern skills** — Per-genre architecture templates (e.g., top-down shooter, platformer, tower defense). Built from real pipeline runs, not theoretical.
- `R-108` **Tester subagent** — Dedicated E2E and gameplay testing role in the multi-agent pipeline.
- `R-109` **GDD quality review** — Automated completeness and consistency checks on generated Game Design Documents.
- `R-110` **Android build workflow** — APK/AAB export with signing, versioning, and store-ready packaging.
- `R-111` **Sprite sheet animation pipeline** — Generate multi-frame sprite sheets from single-frame AI-generated sprites.
- `R-112` **Re-evaluate gdtoolkit (gdlint / gdformat)** *(low priority)* — Disabled in v0.3.4 due to recurring `gdtoolkit/linter/class_checks.py:144 NotImplementedError` crashes on ECS-style class shapes. Rationale + restore guide in [`docs/decisions/disable-gdtoolkit.md`](docs/decisions/disable-gdtoolkit.md).
