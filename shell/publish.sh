# Publish GodotMaker skills into a target Godot project directory.

#
# On upgrade, compares VERSION against the target's .godotmaker/version:
#   PATCH  -> auto-proceed
#   MINOR  -> show changelog, prompt for confirmation
#   MAJOR  -> strong warning, prompt for confirmation
# Use --force to skip confirmation prompts and allow downgrades.

# Thin wrapper — all logic is in tools/publish.py.
# KEEP IN SYNC with publish.ps1 (Windows PowerShell equivalent)
