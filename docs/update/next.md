## Added

- (WIP) Diagnostic log at `.godotmaker/log_agent_tool_debug.log` that records every phase of `log_agent_tool.py` so the next failure mode is localizable from artifacts.

## Changed

- Clarified source-available licensing language and excluded internal planning notes from the documentation site.

## Fixed

- (WIP) Rewire Agent prompt/output trace capture to `PreToolUse`/`PostToolUse` because the `SubagentStart` payload has no `prompt` field and silently wrote 0-byte traces.

## Removed
