## Added

- (WIP) Diagnostic log at `.godotmaker/log_agent_tool_debug.log` that records every phase of `log_agent_tool.py` so the next failure mode is localizable from artifacts.

## Changed

- Verifier and worker docs no longer prescribe authoring or running e2e — `/gm-evaluate` is the single source of truth for `e2e/`.

## Fixed

- (WIP) Rewire Agent prompt/output trace capture to `PreToolUse`/`PostToolUse` because the `SubagentStart` payload has no `prompt` field and silently wrote 0-byte traces.
- Drop the SubagentStop hook's e2e content requirement on worker reports, since `check_file_permissions` already forbids workers from writing `e2e/`.
- Move `project.godot.run/main_scene` retargeting from decomposer to `/gm-build`'s dispatching agent so headless runs between `/gm-gdd` and the entry-scene worker no longer flood logs with `Cannot open file`.

## Removed
