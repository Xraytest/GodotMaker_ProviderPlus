# GodotMaker

**Bring a game idea. Let GodotMaker turn it into a playable Godot project.**

GodotMaker turns a game idea into a playable Godot 4 project through a no-human-in-the-loop run driven by `godotmaker-cli`. It helps shape the idea into a GDD, then plans, builds, tests, runs, screenshots, evaluates, and fixes until the current design scope is complete. The result is a local Godot project rather than a hosted black box. The underlying `/gm-*` role commands remain available for advanced users.

## What You Get

- **Idea-to-GDD generation** - describe the game in natural language, then let the workflow turn it into tasks, structure, scenes, and assets.
- **No-human-in-the-loop runs** - a typical small game takes about 3-5 hours of agent runtime while the CLI keeps the loop moving.
- **Owned local output** - the result is a normal Godot project you can open, inspect, modify, and ship.
- **No closed-platform resale** - GodotMaker is a source-available workflow layer, not a hosted editor that resells agent work and keeps the project locked away.
- **Tested code by default** - unit tests and end-to-end gameplay tests are written alongside the game code.
- **Visual QA included** - the evaluator runs the game, captures screenshots, compares the result to the design, and feeds issues back into the fix loop.
- **Source-available workflow layer** - GodotMaker's workflow source is available under BUSL 1.1 and does not lock the project behind a hosted editor.

## Project Status

GodotMaker is preparing for a source-available public alpha. The CLI, visual QA, and packaging are moving quickly; expect the workflow and docs to keep changing.
