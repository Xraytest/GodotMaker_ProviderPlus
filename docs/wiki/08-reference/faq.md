# Frequently Asked Questions

---

## Getting started

### Do I need to know game development?

No. GodotMaker is designed for people who have a game idea but are not game developers. You describe what you want in plain English, confirm the design feels right when it's shown to you, and let the AI do the implementation. That said, you will need to read your `GDD.md` and say whether it captures what you meant — the AI writes it, but you approve it.

### Do I need a paid API key?

Only if your project config selects an API-backed provider. The default config uses native VQA and native image generation. `GOOGLE_API_KEY` or `GEMINI_API_KEY` is required for `gemini:<model>`, `OPENAI_API_KEY` for `openai:<model>`, `XAI_API_KEY` for `grok:<model>`, and `TRIPO3D_API_KEY` for GLB generation.

Claude Code itself requires an Anthropic account with API access (or a Claude Pro / Team subscription with Claude Code enabled).

See the installation page for setup instructions.

### What Godot version do I need?

Godot 4.5 or later. GodotMaker does not support Godot 3.x or Godot 4.3 and below.

### How long does it take to make a game?

For a small game, expect roughly **3-5 hours of agent runtime**. Your own attention is usually front-loaded into clarifying the idea and later reviewing the result. After the design is clear, `godotmaker-cli` drives the same `/gm-*` roles through planning, build, verification, evaluation, screenshots, and fixes without you manually triggering every command. More ambitious games scale with the number of tasks in `PLAN.md`.

### Can I use C# instead of GDScript?

Yes. GodotMaker supports both GDScript and C#. ECS components and systems can be written in either language. Make sure you are using a .NET-enabled Godot build when working with C#.

## Pipeline behaviour

### What is a tag?

A **tag** is one complete pass through the pipeline: `/gm-gdd`, `/gm-asset`, `/gm-build`, `/gm-verify`, `/gm-evaluate`, `/gm-fixgap` as needed, `/gm-accept`, and `/gm-finalize`. Tags are SemVer-named — the first tag is always `v0.1.0` and must deliver a playable closed loop; later tags add a feature set or rework existing systems. `ROADMAP.md` lists the planned tags; the earliest one without a `git tag` is the current tag. The CLI drives this flow for normal runs. Advanced users can still start the next tag manually with `/gm-gdd`; `/gm-scaffold` runs only once per project and is not repeated between tags.

### What if I want to stop halfway through?

You can stop at any point. The next time you open the project, GodotMaker reads `.godotmaker/stage.jsonl` to see where you left off. In the normal CLI path, run `godotmaker` again to resume. In manual role-command mode, run the same `/gm-*` role again to pick up where you stopped.

For a full walkthrough of recovery scenarios, see [Recovery & Resume](../04-troubleshooting/recovery-and-resume.md).

### Can I run two role commands at the same time?

No. Each role writes its name to `.godotmaker/current_role` when it starts, and hook scripts use that file to enforce write permissions. If a second role tried to start while one was already running, the file-permission hook would immediately start blocking unexpected writes. Let the CLI manage the sequence, or in manual mode run one role at a time and wait for it to complete.

### Why are some commands re-runnable and others are not?

`/gm-scaffold` is a once-per-project command — re-running it on an existing project would overwrite the project setup. `/gm-asset` is re-runnable within a tag whenever new assets are needed. The commands from `/gm-build` onward follow the per-tag cycle: they should run in order, and re-running one re-does that phase of the current tag. In manual mode, `/gm-gdd` starts a new tag.

### What happens inside `/gm-build`?

`/gm-build` works through the task list in `PLAN.md` by dispatching **Workers** until every task is `completed`, then runs one verify+review pass — a **Verifier** builds the project headlessly and runs the tests, then a **Reviewer** checks for Godot-specific pitfalls. The main agent triages each finding into one of three options: ACCEPT (add as a new task in `PLAN.md`), REJECT (the finding is wrong — record in `MEMORY.md`'s **Reviewer Triage Log**), or SKIP (the finding is real but not worth fixing now — same MEMORY.md section). REJECT/SKIP for critical/major findings requires a citation; both are shown in `/gm-accept` or final review summaries. The cycle loops until no new findings are ACCEPTED. The `check_completion.py` hook refuses to let `/gm-build` end if workers ran but the verifier or reviewer never did.

### Why does the AI need git worktrees?

When `/gm-build` runs multiple workers in parallel, each worker needs its own folder to write files into without conflicting with the others. Git worktrees let multiple working directories share the same repository history. This is also why `/gm-scaffold` creates an initial git commit — worktrees require at least one commit to exist.

## Quality and output

### Why doesn't my game look exactly like the GDD says?

AI code generation is not deterministic, and complex interactions between game systems can produce unexpected results. That is what `/gm-evaluate` and `/gm-fixgap` are for: the evaluator scores the running game against your GDD and produces a gap list, then fixgap dispatches workers to close each gap. Running this loop once is usually enough for a small game; larger games may benefit from a second pass.

### Can I edit the generated code by hand?

Yes, and your edits will be preserved. Be aware that if you run `/gm-build` again for a new tag, it may add new tasks that touch the same files — so your edits could be extended or partially overwritten by new worker output. Keep your hand-edits focused and document them in `MEMORY.md` so the AI knows they were intentional.

### Where do I find screenshots and test results?

- Per-scene visual reference targets (generated by `/gm-asset`): `references/scene_<name>.png`
- Runtime screenshots captured during evaluation: `e2e/screenshots/`
- Animated frame sequences (one subdir per scene): `e2e/screenshots/scene_<name>/frame_*.png`
- Archived evaluate-run screenshots and verdicts: `.godotmaker/evaluation-runs/`
- Evaluation scores and gap list: `.godotmaker/evaluation.json`
- Hook and pipeline metrics: `.godotmaker/metrics_current.jsonl`

### Why ECS instead of plain Godot scripts?

Plain Godot node scripts tend to mix data, logic, and scene structure in one file. As the game grows, these files get harder to change without breaking something. ECS separates concerns cleanly: data lives in components, logic lives in systems, and entities are just IDs that connect them. For AI-generated code this matters a lot — new behaviour is always a new component plus a new system, not an edit to an existing 1000-line script.

For a longer explanation, see [ECS in plain English](../02-concepts/ecs-in-plain-english.md).

### How do I know if the build succeeded?

After `/gm-verify` completes, it prints a per-check pass/fail report and — on overall success — appends a `verify` event to `.godotmaker/stage.jsonl`. Each worker's report during `/gm-build` also records whether its tests passed. If the Godot headless build fails or unit tests fail, verification reports the failure and routes the workflow back to build or fixgap as appropriate.

## Cost and privacy

### Where does my game data go?

All game files live locally on your machine. AI calls go to whatever model provider your selected agent runtime uses. API-backed image generation calls go to the provider selected by `asset_image_model` (Gemini, OpenAI, or xAI); `native` generation is handled by the active runtime, and `codex` generation is handled by Codex. No game content is stored on GodotMaker's servers because GodotMaker has no servers — it is a local framework.

### Is my game project mine?

Yes. GodotMaker only deploys files into your folder and then the AI fills them in. Games, project source code, assets, screenshots, reports, exports, and other outputs created with GodotMaker are not GodotMaker and belong to you. The GodotMaker framework itself is source-available under its own license, but your game content and code are yours, subject to any third-party engine, asset, model-provider, runtime, or dependency terms that may apply.

## Troubleshooting

### A hook keeps blocking me and I can't proceed.

Hooks have a built-in anti-deadloop limit. `check_completion.py` allows up to 5 consecutive blocks before force-allowing; `check_worker_report.py` allows up to 2 blocks per sub-agent. If you are hitting these limits repeatedly something in the pipeline has gone wrong — check the failing sub-agent's report for missing sections or malformed output.

For common hook errors and how to read them, see [Common problems](../04-troubleshooting/common-problems.md).

### I get "fatal: not a valid object name: HEAD" when a worker starts.

This means the project has no git commits yet. `/gm-scaffold` should have created one. Re-run setup/scaffold through the CLI or manual command, or create an initial commit manually with `git commit --allow-empty -m "init"`.

### My evaluation score is low but the game seems fine to me.

The evaluator uses visual QA against per-scene reference images and the GDD description. If `/gm-asset` did not generate `references/scene_*.png` files, the evaluator has no visual reference to compare against and will score conservatively. Run the asset command again to generate the missing references before re-evaluating.

### How do I roll back to a previous GodotMaker version?

Check out the older version tag in the GodotMaker repo, then re-publish with `--force`:

```bash
git checkout v0.1.0          # in the GodotMaker repo
python tools/publish.py --force /path/to/my-game
```

The `--force` flag does a few things at once: it skips MINOR/MAJOR upgrade prompts, allows downgrades, and for Claude Code targets overwrites `.claude/settings.json`. The full clean re-initialisation (wiping the selected agent's skills, `.godotmaker/hooks/`, runtime state files, etc.) only happens on **MAJOR** upgrades — on PATCH/MINOR/SAME the existing framework files are simply overwritten in place. So in the downgrade example above, `--force` mainly serves to override the downgrade block.

### The pipeline references "stages" or "roles." What gives?

"Stage" was the original GodotMaker term for a pipeline step. The framework now exposes role-based commands such as `/gm-build`, and `godotmaker-cli` can drive those roles for normal runs. Some file names (like `stage.jsonl` and `stage_schemas.json`) still use the old word for continuity. Treat "stage" and "role" as synonyms when you see them in tool output or older docs. See also: *Stage vs Role* in the Glossary.
