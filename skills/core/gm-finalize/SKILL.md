# GodotMaker Finalize

$ARGUMENTS

You are sealing the **current tag** (vX.Y.Z) so the next `/gm-gdd` round can start cleanly. This is a per-tag operation, not a "the game is finished" operation. The user may continue to the next tag right after, or stop here — either way, this tag's deliverables are now archived and git-tagged.

## Session Setup

**FIRST ACTION — before anything else:** Write `finalize` to `.godotmaker/current_role`.

## Resume Check

Read `.godotmaker/stage.jsonl` (treat as empty if missing) — each line is `{"role": X, "ts": Y, ...}`.

- If `PLAN.md` does not exist or is missing the `**Tag:**` header → STOP. Tell the user the project is in a bad state; re-run `/gm-gdd` to regenerate the current tag's working docs.
- If **no event with `role == "accept"` and `decision == "accept"`** exists anywhere in the file → STOP. Tell user to run `/gm-accept` first.
  (Events with `decision == "fix"` or `decision == "done"` are trace records, not completions.)
- If `.godotmaker/final_report.json` exists **and** `git tag <Tag>` already exists → STOP. Tell the user:
  > "Tag {Tag} already finalized. Run /gm-gdd to start the next tag, or stop here.
  > If you need to redo this step or have other plans, just tell me."
- Otherwise → proceed.

## Resolve `godot` binary

Read `godot_path` from `.claude/godotmaker.yaml` and substitute it
verbatim for `<godot_path>` in every `godot --headless …` command
below. The path was validated at publish time and is the source of
truth for which Godot binary this project uses.

If `.claude/godotmaker.yaml` is missing the `godot_path` field, fall
back to plain `godot` (PATH lookup). If THAT also fails, STOP and tell
the user `Godot binary not configured — re-run tools/publish.py to set
godot_path in .claude/godotmaker.yaml`. Do NOT spelunk through PATH
directories or guess install locations.

## Process

### 1. Read the current tag

Read `PLAN.md`, extract `**Tag:**` header value (e.g. `v0.2.0`). All later steps refer to this as `<Tag>`.

### 2. Quick Sanity Check

- `"<godot_path>" --headless --quit 2>&1` — builds clean
- `PLAN.md` — no `pending` or `in_progress` tasks; all `verified`
- `.godotmaker/evaluation.json` exists with `result: "approve"`

If any check fails, STOP and tell the user which one — finalize must not seal a broken tag.

### 3. Document Consistency Check (current tag scope)

For each per-tag document, verify it matches what was actually built **in this tag**. Do NOT update prior tags' archives.

- **GDD.md**: Cross-tag "north star". If the user changed design intent during this tag's gm-gdd round, GDD should already reflect it. Check that no claims about future tags have leaked in.
- **PLAN.md**: All tasks `verified`. Tag Mechanics + Inherited Mechanics sections present and complete.
- **STRUCTURE.md**: Components and Systems listed match what actually exists in code. Run a quick scan: list `extends Component` / `extends System` files and reconcile.
- **ASSETS.md**: Verify rows match `assets/` directory contents.
- **SCENES.md**: Scene descriptions match actual scenes added in this tag.
- **MEMORY.md**: Cross-tag accumulator. Append-only since the previous tag — don't rewrite history; if a previous discovery was later proven wrong, mark it `(superseded by …)` instead of deleting.

For any inconsistency: update the doc to match reality. Do NOT change code here — finalize is a paper-trail step.

### 4. Archive into `docs/tags/<Tag>/`

From the project root run:

```bash
python tools/seal_tag.py archive <Tag>
```

The helper copies six per-tag working docs (overwriting any earlier partial archive):

| Destination | Source |
|---|---|
| `docs/tags/<Tag>/GDD-snapshot.md` | `GDD.md` |
| `docs/tags/<Tag>/PLAN.md` | `PLAN.md` |
| `docs/tags/<Tag>/STRUCTURE.md` | `STRUCTURE.md` |
| `docs/tags/<Tag>/SCENES.md` | `SCENES.md` |
| `docs/tags/<Tag>/MEMORY.md` | `MEMORY.md` |
| `docs/tags/<Tag>/evaluation-final.json` | `.godotmaker/evaluation.json` |

Exit codes: 2 if any source is missing, 1 if a copy fails mid-loop.

Then verify the archive landed — list `docs/tags/<Tag>/` and confirm all six destination files are present. If the directory is missing a file or has stale content (size or mtime mismatching the source), STOP and report to the user.

Do not Edit/Write these destinations yourself.

Do NOT archive `ASSETS.md`, `.godotmaker/stage.jsonl`, `metrics.jsonl`, or `traces/`.

### 5. Generate `docs/tags/<Tag>/CHANGELOG.md`

From the project root run:

```bash
python tools/seal_tag.py bundle <Tag>
```

The bundle JSON on stdout has:
- `roadmap_entry` (heading + body from ROADMAP.md for `<Tag>`)
- `plan_tag_mechanics` (list of `<Tag>-Mn` IDs)
- `previous_tag` + `git_log_since_previous_tag` (`--oneline` slice)
- `test_count.unit` (count of `test/**/*.gd`) + `test_count.e2e` (count of `e2e/**/test_*.py`)

Combine that with PLAN.md task table and `evaluation.json` `minor_issues`, and write `docs/tags/<Tag>/CHANGELOG.md` in this format:

```markdown
# Changelog — <Tag>

**Released:** <UTC ISO date>
**Theme:** <ROADMAP headline>

## Delivered mechanics

- [<Tag>-M1] <description>
- [<Tag>-M2] ...

## Added systems / scenes / assets

- <bulleted list pulled from PLAN.md>

## Refactored from prior tags (if any)

- <files / systems modified that belonged to a previous tag, with one-line reason>

## Known limitations

- <minor issues from evaluation.json that ship as-is>
```

### 6. Generate Final Report

Field sources for the schema below:
- `summary.tag_mechanics` — bundle `plan_tag_mechanics` (from step 5)
- `summary.test_count.unit` — bundle `test_count.unit` (direct)
- `summary.test_count.e2e_tag` + `e2e_regression` — split bundle `test_count.e2e` by which test files were added this tag (use PLAN's task table / git log to decide)
- `summary.systems_added` + `components_added` — PLAN task table (already in context from step 3)
- `known_limitations` — `evaluation.json` `minor_issues` + MEMORY.md's "Known limitations" entries
- `doc_updates` — root docs you edited in step 3

Write `.godotmaker/final_report.json`:

```json
{
  "status": "tag_sealed",
  "tag": "<Tag>",
  "completed_at": "UTC timestamp",
  "archive_path": "docs/tags/<Tag>/",
  "git_tagged": true,
  "summary": {
    "tag_mechanics": ["<Tag>-M1", ...],
    "systems_added": [...],
    "components_added": [...],
    "test_count": {"unit": N, "e2e_tag": M, "e2e_regression": K}
  },
  "doc_updates": ["list of root docs updated in step 3"],
  "known_limitations": ["from MEMORY.md and evaluation minor_issues"]
}
```

`final_report.json` is **per-tag overwritten** — only the latest tag's report is kept at this path. Historical reports are recoverable from the `docs/tags/<Tag>/` archives via git history if needed.

### 7. Commit pre-tag state

`git add -A && git commit -m "chore(finalize): seal <Tag>"`

This is the commit `git tag <Tag>` will point at — it includes the archive (step 4), CHANGELOG (step 5), final_report.json (step 6), and the full pre-truncation `.godotmaker/stage.jsonl` for this tag.

### 8. Run `git tag <Tag>`

```bash
git tag <Tag>
```

If the tag already exists locally, skip silently. If git is unavailable in the project, log the gap and continue.

Do NOT push the tag. Pushing is a separate user decision.

### 9. Reset per-tag runtime state

From the project root run:

```bash
python tools/seal_tag.py reset
```

That truncates `.godotmaker/stage.jsonl` and deletes `.godotmaker/metrics_current.jsonl`. Exit 1 if `.godotmaker/` is missing or the truncate/delete fails.

It does NOT touch: `.godotmaker/metrics.jsonl` (cross-session history), `.godotmaker/traces/`, `.godotmaker/config.yaml`, `.godotmaker/hooks/`, `.godotmaker/version`, `.godotmaker/evaluation.json`, `.godotmaker/current_role` (step 12 clears it).

Then verify the reset landed — `.godotmaker/stage.jsonl` is empty (0 bytes) and `.godotmaker/metrics_current.jsonl` does not exist. If either check fails, STOP and report.

The root-level per-tag working docs (`PLAN.md`, `STRUCTURE.md`, `SCENES.md`) stay at root.

### 10. Append finalize event

From the project root run `python tools/append_stage_event.py finalize --tag=<Tag>` to append a `{"role": "finalize", "ts": "<server-generated UTC>", "tag": "<Tag>"}` line to `.godotmaker/stage.jsonl`. Do NOT hand-write the JSON or the timestamp — the helper exists so the timestamp comes from the system clock, not your own output.

> Note: this re-creates `stage.jsonl` after step 9 truncated it. The single finalize event is the only thing that lives in the new tag's stage.jsonl until /gm-gdd subsequent-mode adds its own event.

### 11. Commit post-tag stage event

`git add -A && git commit -m "chore(finalize): post-seal stage event"`

Captures the truncated stage.jsonl plus the new finalize marker — runtime metadata for the next `/gm-gdd` round, not part of `<Tag>`.

### 12. Clear current_role and inform user

Delete `.godotmaker/current_role` AFTER step 10 has completed — that write needs the role lock in place so `check_file_permissions.py` keeps the finalize permission scope active.

Then print:

```
## Tag <Tag> Sealed

**{game_name}** — tag <Tag> archived and git-tagged.

- Archive: docs/tags/<Tag>/
- Git tag: <Tag> (local; not pushed)
- Tag mechanics delivered: {Tag Mechanics list}
- Doc updates this round: {list or "none needed"}
- Known limitations: {list or "none"}

Remaining tags in ROADMAP.md: {list of unshipped tags}

To start the next tag: /gm-gdd
To package this tag as a release: use the release skill (separate)
To stop here: just don't run anything else — the archive is permanent.
```

## What this skill explicitly does NOT do

- **No release packaging.** Building a distributable archive (zip / installer / web export) is the job of a separate release skill, invoked at the user's choice.
- **No `git push`.** The tag stays local until the user pushes it.
- **No code changes.** Finalize is paper-trail + archive only.
- **No cross-tag history rewrite.** Older tags' archives in `docs/tags/v0.X.Y/` are immutable from this skill's perspective.
